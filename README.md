# ShellTools

Simple shell tools on Windows.

The code from a programming novice, trying to implement some simple functions that individuals may need on the Windows terminal.

## closeMonitor

Run the program and the computer will turn off the monitor after 1 second by default. If you enter the `-t` flag, you can specify the delay time (seconds). Enter the `-s` flag to make the computer sleep instead of just turning off the monitor.
